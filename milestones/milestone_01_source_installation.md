---

## Today's Achievement
**Successfully installed PostgreSQL from source code and ran my first database server**

## Documentation Reference
- **PostgreSQL Version**: 18 (Development)
- **Chapters Used**: 
    - Chapter 17: Installation from Source Code
    - 17.1 Requirements
    - 17.2 Getting the Source
    - 17.3 Building and Installation with Autoconf and Make
    - 17.5 Post-Installation Setup

## Technical Milestones Completed

### 1. Environment Preparation
- Verified and installed all WSL Ubuntu missing requirements
- Set up proper development environment

### 2. Source Code Management

git clone https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git /home/victorlzfr/postgresql-install


### 3. Build Process Execution

./configure
make
make check
su
make install


### 4. PostgreSQL Installation & Configuration

PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
adduser postgres
mkdir -p /usr/local/pgsql/data
chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data


### 5. Database Server Initialization

su - postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile start


### 6. First Database Operations

/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test


## Concepts Mastered

### Build Tools & Process
- Understanding of Autoconf and Make build systems
- Compilation process for large C projects
- Dependency management and requirements verification

### System Administration
- Linux user and group management (adduser, chown)
- Filesystem permissions and directory structure
- Service management and process control

### PostgreSQL Architecture
- Data directory structure and purpose
- Database cluster initialization
- Client-server communication setup
- Configuration file management

### Troubleshooting Skills
- Dependency resolution
- Permission issues handling
- Service startup verification
- Log file analysis

## Technical Insights Gained

1. **Source vs Package Installation**: Understanding the differences and benefits of compiling from source
2. **Directory Structure**: Learned PostgreSQL's binary vs data directory separation
3. **User Security**: Importance of dedicated system users for database services
4. **Build Validation**: Significance of make check in verifying installation integrity

## Next Learning Objectives

- [ ] Database user management and permissions
- [ ] Basic SQL operations and table creation
- [ ] Configuration file tuning (postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf)
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Performance monitoring basics

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation is crucial**: Active reading of official docs prevented many potential issues
2. **Step verification**: Each command's success should be verified before proceeding
3. **Environment variables**: Understanding PATH and other environment settings is essential
4. **Tool assistance**: Using DeepSeek for clarification accelerated learning process
