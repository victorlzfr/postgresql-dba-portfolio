## Process Completed

1. **Basic SQL Query Operations**
   - Executed SELECT statements with * shorthand and explicit column lists
   - Practiced mathematical expressions in queries (temperature averages)
   - Applied WHERE clauses with Boolean operators for filtering
   - Used ORDER BY for single and multi-column sorting
   - Implemented DISTINCT for duplicate removal and combined with ORDER BY

2. **Table Joins Implementation**
   - Practiced INNER JOIN between weather and cities tables
   - Executed LEFT OUTER JOIN to include unmatched rows with NULL values
   - Compared explicit JOIN/ON syntax vs older implicit syntax
   - Qualified column names to avoid ambiguity in join queries
   - Performed self-join on weather table with table aliases

3. **Database Navigation and Management**
   - Connected to PostgreSQL database using psql command
   - Listed database tables using \dt command
   - Examined table structures and relationships
   - Verified query results against expected documentation examples
