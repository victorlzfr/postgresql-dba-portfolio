## Process Completed

1. **Repository Structure Reorganization**
   - Created hierarchical folder structure: 2025 → months → weeks
   - Organized milestones chronologically with date-specific weekly folders
   - Moved all milestone files into appropriate weekly directories

2. **Folder Naming Convention Implementation**
   - Established consistent naming: `week_01_sep_24_30`, `week_02_oct_01_07`, `week_03_oct_08_14`
   - Separated September and October milestones by month
   - Implemented clear date ranges for each weekly folder

3. **Git Repository Management**
   - Successfully aborted problematic interactive rebase operation
   - Reset local repository to match remote exactly using `git reset --hard origin/main`
   - Resolved rebase conflicts and restored clean working state
