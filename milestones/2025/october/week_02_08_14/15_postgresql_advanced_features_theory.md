## Time Spent: 50 minutes 

## Process Completed

1. **Theoretical Learning - Advanced Features**
   - Read PostgreSQL documentation Chapter 3.1 (Introduction to Advanced Features)
   - Studied Chapter 3.2 (Views) and learned how to create named queries for simplified access
   - Covered Chapter 3.3 (Foreign Keys) and understood referential integrity concepts
   - Learned Chapter 3.4 (Transactions) and the atomicity principle for database operations

2. **Concept Understanding**
   - Learned how views encapsulate complex queries behind simple interfaces
   - Understood foreign key constraints and their role in maintaining data relationships
   - Grasped transaction atomicity through the bank transfer example
   - Clarified that foreign keys typically reference primary keys in parent tables

3. **Database Design Principles**
   - Studied the importance of referential integrity in application quality
   - Learned how views can abstract underlying table structures from applications
   - Understood the critical role of transactions in ensuring data consistency
   - Recognized best practices for using these advanced features in database design
