chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data

5. Database Server Initialization
su - postgres
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile start

6. First Database Operations
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test

## Concepts Mastered
- Build Tools & Process: Autoconf and Make build systems, compilation process for large C projects
