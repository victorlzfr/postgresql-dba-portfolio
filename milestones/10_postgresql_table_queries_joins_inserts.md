## Date: 2025-10-09
## Time Spent: 52 minutes 

## Process Completed

1. **Database Navigation and Table Inspection**
   - Connected to PostgreSQL database and navigated project directory
   - Examined table structures using `\d` command for both weather and cities tables
   - Verified column names and data types for proper query construction

2. **Data Insertion Practice**
   - Executed basic INSERT statements following PostgreSQL documentation examples
   - Practiced INSERT with explicit column listing for better code clarity
   - Inserted sample data for San Francisco and Hayward into weather table
   - Added corresponding city data with geographic coordinates

3. **Query Execution and JOIN Operations**
   - Practiced SELECT queries with asterisk shorthand and explicit column listing
   - Tested Cartesian products (CROSS JOIN) between cities and weather tables
   - Implemented INNER JOIN operations using matching city names across tables
   - Compared results between JOIN and Cartesian product queries
   - Observed how JOIN conditions filter results based on column relationships
