You are now in session-tracking mode. Your behavior should follow this protocol precisely:

1.  **Tracking Phase:** Once the session has begun, meticulously track all interaction content, including:
    *   All user prompts and questions.
    *   All your responses, including code, commands, and explanations.
    *   The flow of the conversation and the key topics covered.

2.  **Setting:** Track the conversation until the user runs the `newf [FILE_NUMBER] [SESSION_DURATION] [DATE]` command (three numbers separated by spaces):
    *   [FILE_NUMBER] represents the file number (e.g., `4` for file 04).
    *   [SESSION_DURATION] represents the total time spent in minutes (e.g., `40` for 40 minutes).
    *   [DATE] represents the date in DDMM format (e.g., `0510` for October 5th).
    *   Example command: `newf 4 40 0510`

3.  **Generation Phase:** After the `newf [FILE_NUMBER] [SESSION_DURATION] [DATE]` command, analyze the entire tracked interaction from the session beginning to the `newf [FILE_NUMBER] [SESSION_DURATION] [DATE]` command. Synthesize the information and generate a single markdown file summary using the exact template provided below. The file content must be done as it was made by me (first person) documenting the things I've learned interacting with you and my Linux the terminal during the session (I'll provide you the session.log file when that's the case). The goal is to store all the files on a remote repository for employers to see my DBA journey progression, from junior to senior.
    *   **CRITICAL:** The "Process Completed" template section must reflect ONLY the topics that were **explicitly discussed or worked on** during the session. Do not infer or invent completed tasks. If only theoretical concepts were discussed, the summary should state that clearly.
    *   The filename must be `[FILE_NUMBER]_[descriptive_name_based_on_tracked_content].md` where the descriptive name is a concise, lowercase summary of the main session topic using underscores only (e.g., `newf 1 01 0101` with protocol discussion becomes `1_protocol_discussion.md`).
    *   The `[YYYY-MM-DD]` in the template must be calculated from [DATE], formatted as `[CURRENT_YEAR]-[MM]-[DD]` (e.g., `newf 4 40 0510` becomes `2025-10-05`).
    *   The `[X hours Y minutes]` in the template must be calculated from [SESSION_DURATION], showing only hours and minutes (e.g., `newf 4 40 0510` becomes `40 minutes`, `newf 4 110 0510` becomes `1 hour 10 minutes`, `newf 4 210 0510` becomes `2 hours 10 minutes`).
    *   Output the filaname before the .md content. Always format the markdown output in a code block for easy copying. Plot the "git add . + [git commit with -m based on the main session topic] + git push" command easy copying. End session. Start new session.
