A comprehensive, hands-on journey from fundamentals to advanced PostgreSQL Database Administration. This repository documents my systematic progression through practical skills, theoretical concepts, and real-world scenarios essential for a professional DBA role.

## 🎯 Project Mission

**Transitioning to a PostgreSQL DBA Role** through structured, documented learning and practical implementation. Each milestone represents verified skills and conceptual understanding gained through hands-on experience.

## 📚 Learning Methodology

### Structured Progression
- **Source-First Approach**: Building PostgreSQL from source for deep architectural understanding
- **Documentation-Driven**: Following official PostgreSQL documentation as primary guide
- **Milestone-Based**: Breaking down complex topics into achievable, verifiable skills
- **Time-Tracked**: Monitoring progress with detailed time investment records

### Skill Verification
Every technical achievement is:
- ✅ Practically implemented in a production-like environment
- ✅ Documented with commands, configurations, and outcomes
- ✅ Validated against official PostgreSQL documentation
- ✅ Assessed for conceptual understanding

## 🗓️ Current Progress

### 🎉 Completed Milestones
